""" Addons module.

This module serves to contain all CrossNow addons, across all configured addons
paths. For the code to manage those addons, see crossnow.modules.

Addons are made available under `crossnow.addons` after
crossnow.tools.config.parse_config() is called (so that the addons paths are
known).

This module also conveniently reexports some symbols from crossnow.modules.
Importing them from here is deprecated.

"""
# make crossnow.addons a namespace package, while keeping this __init__.py
# present, for python 2 compatibility
